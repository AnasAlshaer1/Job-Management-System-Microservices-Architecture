🌐 Job Management System (Microservices)A scalable, distributed job management system built with Spring Boot Microservices. This project demonstrates the transition from a monolithic architecture to a decoupled system, utilizing modern DevOps tools like Docker, Zipkin, and PostgreSQL.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe system is composed of three core microservices that communicate synchronously to provide a unified data view:Job Microservice (8082): Manages job postings, salaries, and locations.Company Microservice (8081): Handles organizational data and profiles.Review Microservice (8083): Manages user feedback and ratings for specific companies.🛠️ Key Technical Implementations1. Inter-Service CommunicationSynchronous Communication: Services interact using RestTemplate and the DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern.Unified Responses: When a Job is requested, the JobMS fetches related data from CompanyMS and ReviewMS to return a complete response.2. Service Discovery & RegistryEureka Server: Acts as a service registry where all microservices register themselves, allowing them to communicate via service names rather than hardcoded IP addresses.3. Distributed TracingZipkin & Micrometer: Integrated to monitor request flows across the distributed system.Observability: Used to identify latency issues and troubleshoot bottlenecks in the communication between services.4. Persistence & MonitoringPostgreSQL: Each service is configured to use a persistent PostgreSQL database container.Spring Boot Actuator: Enabled to monitor service health, metrics, and application info.🐳 Docker ConfigurationThe system is containerized using Docker and managed via Docker Compose. All services run within a custom network for secure internal communication.Core Ports Mapping:ServiceInternal PortExternal/Host URLCompany MS8081http://localhost:8081Job MS8082http://localhost:8082Review MS8083http://localhost:8083Zipkin9411http://localhost:9411pgAdmin80http://localhost:5050🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesDocker Desktop installed.Maven for building JAR files.InstallationPackage the Microservices:Bashmvn clean package -DskipTests

📮 Postman TestingYou can test the APIs by sending requests to the following endpoints. Ensure the Content-Type is set to application/json.Example: Creating a New JobURL: POST http://localhost:8082/jobsBody:JSON{
